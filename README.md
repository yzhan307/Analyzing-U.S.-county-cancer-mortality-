Based on the cancer data of U.S. counties, this project aims to address the following main issues: 
•	Building a multivariate linear regression model based on the cancer data. 
•	Identifying the key factors that tightly correlated with cancer mortality rates in US counties. 
•	Understanding the relationships and interactions between different variables in the context of cancer mortality. 
•	Estimating cancer mortality rates based on these factors. 
Research questions and hypotheses include:
•	Which socio-economic factors have the most significant impact on cancer mortality rates?
•	How do demographic factors like race, insurance coverage influence cancer mortality rates?
•	What is the effect of  one set of variables on cancer mortality rate after taking into account rest of the variables?
•	Lower poverty associates with lower cancer mortality rates?
•	Will counties with higher percentages of residents with health coverage have lower cancer mortality rates.
•	How accurate can we predict cancer mortality rate for U.S. counties? 
Data source:
The dataset for this project is called “cancer”, it was aggregated from three sources: American Community Survey, clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov. The data was compiled by Noah Ripper on “data.World” website. 
The “cancer” data includes 3047 observations which are 3047 U.S. counties. There are 34 variables in this data, with 33 independent variables and 1 target variable. These variables were related to demographics, socio-economic status, health coverage, and cancer-related clinical trials.  The Target variable is “Mean per capita cancer mortalities” which is the mean number of deaths related to cancer per year for every 100,000 population in a county through year 2010-2016. 
The 33 Independent variables were divided into 5 categories (detailed variable list in appendix):
1)	Number of cases diagnosed, 4 variables. 
2)	Economic factors such as income, unemployment rate, health coverage,10 variables 
3)	Population, age, marriage, and other social factors, 9 variables
4)	Education, 6 variables 
5)	Ethnicity, 4 variables
